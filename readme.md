## IR Remote Receiver Tutorial

For a detailed guide on how to set up and use an Arduino IR remote receiver, please refer to [this tutorial](https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/) on Circuit Basics.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// Initialize the library with the LCD interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);

void setup() {
  // Set up the LCD's number of columns and rows
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  // Print a message to the LCD
  lcd.print("Hello, World!");
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```
